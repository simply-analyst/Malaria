# MALARIA CASES AND DEATHS â€“ A DATA DRIVEN ANALYSIS

## Description
This project was carried out in order to gain insights into the temporal and geographical distribution of malaria, assessing its impact, and identifying key trends and patterns. The dataset used provided information on malaria cases and deaths across multiple countries, categorized by year and WHO Region.

-	Calculate and compare the CFR (deaths per reported cases) across regions.
-	Highlight countries with the highest number of cases and deaths.
-	Training models to predict the number of deaths caused by malaria in coming years.

## Insights
-	Africa had the highest number of reported malaria cases (545,111,852) and deaths (1,480,850).
-	Europe had the lowest number of reported malaria cases (112,675) and deaths (25).
